## 📖 Example Workflow

1. Researcher uploads their work (paper, dataset, code).  
2. GENOME AI extracts metadata, hashes, and timestamps it.  
3. AI suggests *license terms* (fees, revenue share, derivatives).  
4. Researcher mints *IP NFT + License Tokens*.  
5. Other users acquire tokens → gain access or create derivatives.  
6. Disputes (if any) are resolved via the *governance layer*.
